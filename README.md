# Portfolio Using NextJS

Here is the NextJS Project named Fit For Life which is built for a gym using the Tailwind CSS.
 

## Installation

First run the command: 
```bash
npm install 
# or
yarn install
``` 
to get all the npm packages in the project. 

If you had already done with the above process then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) [If you are already using the 3000 port] with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Key Features
